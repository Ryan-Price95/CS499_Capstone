## CS-499 Capstone 

## Professional Self-Assessment
Completing my coursework throughout the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University helped build me into the developer that I am today. Throughout the degree, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, software engineering, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies. These experiences helped me to grow and have shaped my professional values (security minded, collaborative, and always striving to do and learn more) to become a well-rounded developer ready to deliver reliable, efficient, and ethical solutions in the real world. 

### Course Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
Collaboration was essential throughout my degree, but most noticeably in CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, where we went through all major roles within a Scrum team. I learned how to gather and understand requirements, prioritize backlog items, and maintain open communication with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. These skills carried over into courses like CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, where I coordinated test planning and implementation. Throughout these courses, among others, I learned the importance of open and clear communication, whether with stakeholders or with coworkers, and implemented this communication through team-based projects, both throughout school and in my personal, professional life. 

### Course Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
Following the theme of clear communication, this was vital in demonstrating technical expertise to a range of audiences. In CS 465: Full-Stack Development, I produced both written documentation and visual diagrams to describe the design and functionality of the Travlr Getaways web application. Similarly, in this Capstone course, I created this professional ePortfolio, as well as a detailed README to describe the functionality and implementation of the full CMake inventory application. Continuing, throughout my college career, I have needed to create detailed UML diagrams and presentation materials that refined my ability to communicate complex ideas in an accessible way. 

### Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs in design choices
A strong understanding of algorithms and data structures has shaped how I approach software design and optimization. In CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I implemented Binary Search Trees, hash tables, and vectors to explore how algorithmic efficiency impacts performance. Through this, I learned to asses the trade-offs between time and space complexity and to justify my design decisions based on measurable outcomes. Later, I applied these through CS 350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies, where I learned about AI and ML models as well as the algorithms that make them work, building a treasure hunt pirate game where an agent traveled through a course to find the treasure. 

### Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate and ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
My coursework allowed me to eplore modern tools and technologies across multiple computing domains. In CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming, I built an Android Inventory application that demonstrated CRUD functionality and local database storage. Additionally, in CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, I used OpenGL to create visualizations that could be used for detailed graphical needs. Throughout the entirety of my college career, I have used GitHub (and Git in CS 465: Full-Stack Development) to contain and present various projects, various unit testing frameworks, as well as dependency-check tools to maintain professional coding standards. By continuously learning about new tools and innovative approaches, I am able to keep up with this continuously growing technical world. 

### Course Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
Security, throughout this program, has become a defining pillar of my professional identity. In CS 405: Secure Coding, I learned to integrate security at every level of development by implementing encryption algorithms such as AES-256 and SHA-256, managing digital certificates, and conducting secure code reviews. Additionally, in courses like CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering, I deepened my understanding of what software vulnerabilities can appear and behave, as well as how to address and mitigate security concerns, again in CS 405: Secure Coding. 

### Artifacts
My ePortfolio collectively showcases these five outcomes in action. My code review shows my ability to communicate, collaborate, and apply security-minded evaluation, the portfolio itself and the README for my CMake application showcases my ability to design and deliver professional-quality communications, and the application itself showcases outcomes 3, 4, and 5. Demonstrating an integration of algorithmic design principles and managing trade-offs through the implementation of a search feature, the use of techniques and technologies such as wxWidgets for my GUI, and designing with a security mindset by implementing a login feature and ensuring access is limited beyond that. 


## Original Artifact
For this entire project, I decided to use just a single artifact to enhance in the three expected ways, a software development, algorithms, and databases. The artifact that I chose to enhance was from CS 360 where we were tasked with building an Android application that would allow users to log in, access information about the existing inventory, as well as update, add, and remove any inventory from the system. This was built using Android Studio with Java utilizing a SQLite database.
